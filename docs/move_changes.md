# Move changes

Moves have been rebalanced to enhance the viability of certain Pokémon and to offer players a broader range of strategic options overall. The changes are deliberately minimalistic, ensuring that they remain true to the original Gen 1 experience. No mechanics from later generations have been introduced—meaning no new types, no physical/special split, no weather effects, etc.

Feedback is welcome, as long as it aligns with the goal of maintaining the classic Gen 1 feel!

## New moves

There are **three** new moves:
- HEX has been imported from future generations to provide a strong, viable STAB Ghost-type move. It is now part of the Gastly line level-up learnset and is also the only new TM in the game, teachable to Pokémon like Hypno, Ninetales, Marowak, and a few others. HEX gains a 50% damage boost when the opponent is affected by a status condition, introducing a new move effect. However, given its similarity to DREAM EATER and its natural fit with Ghost-types, this addition feels like a seamless and sensible enhancement to the original movepool.
- ELECTRO BALL is a signature move for the Voltorb line which has a high crit rate. Given Electrode's speed and how critical hits are computed in Gen 1, it essentially becomes the best Electric move in the game.
- WILL-O-WISP is a signature move for the Vulpix line. Ninetales suffers in comparison to Arcanine in Gen 1, and this provides it with a much-needed buff (WILL-O-WISP also pairs nicely with HEX).

| ELECTRO BALL | Electric | 55    | 95       | 20 | High critical hit rate (RAZOR LEAF clone)                  |
| WILL-O-WISP  | Fire     | -     | 70       | 15 | Inflicts BURN                                              |


## Type changes

Move type changes are primarily meant to give STAB options to Mons who were lacking them. Notably:
- CUT becomes Bug-type, providing a viable early-game Bug-type move and a decent coverage option to check Psychic-types.
- RAZOR WIND becomes a weaker Bug-type HYPER BEAM, which due to Gen 1 mechanics can skip the recharge turn if it KOes the opponent.
- SLAM becomes Dragon-type, providing dragons with a STAB option and others with a coverage move against dragons.
- STRUGGLE takes the unused Bird type to ignore resistances and immunities to Normal-type moves.

## Other changes

Most other changes were made to increase the viability of some subpar moves, or to give them a niche.
In rare cases moves were nerfed, most notably DIG.
