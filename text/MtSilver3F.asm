; Pokemon Theme Song for reference
;[Verse 1]
;I wanna be the very best
;Like no one ever was
;To catch them is my real test
;To train them is my cause
;I will travel across the land
;Searching far and wide
;Teach Pokémon to understand
;The power that's inside

;[Chorus]
;(Pokémon
;Gotta catch 'em all) It's you and me
;I know it's my destiny (Pokémon)
;Oh, you're my best friend
;In a world we must defend (Pokémon
;Gotta catch 'em all) A heart so true
;Our courage will pull us through
;You teach me and I'll teach you (Ooh, ooh)
;Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all)
;Gotta catch 'em all
;Yeah

;[Verse 2]
;Every challenge along the way
;With courage, I will face
;I will battle every day
;To claim my rightful place
;Come with me, the time is right
;There's no better team
;Arm in arm, we'll win the fight
;It's always been our dream
