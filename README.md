# Pokémon Yume 夢 Red/Green/Blue

This is an enhancement rom hack of Pokémon Red and Blue based on the [pokered disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokered).

夢 (yume) is the Japanese kanji for *dream* – the intent being to provide a reimagined version of these classic games.

Pokémon Yume Red/Blue/Green aims to improve the original games in terms of gameplay balance, story content, and Pokémon accessibility, all the while trying to stay faithful to the Gen 1 experience.
To do this, inspiration was loosely taken from the anime, later Pokémon generations, or the manga.
In some small ways it is also a 'relocalization' effort: it tries to highlight the games' Japanese influence through some new visuals and dialogue.
Its kanji name 夢 is also an homage to [shinpokered](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered), a groundbreaking hack which provided the initial inspiration for this project.

### Main features

### Gameplay updates

**Moves**
- Several moves have been parsimoniously reworked in order to increase their viability while trying to maintain the original feeling of the game. Three new moves have been added.
- Consult the [complete list of move changes](docs/move_changes.md) for more info!
- Ghost is now a Special type, and Dragon a Physical type.
- Fix for Focus energy and Dire hit. (Quadruple critical hit rate instead of dividing it by 4.)

**Learnsets**
- Pokémon learnsets have been revamped in the same spirit: to give more options while trying to maintain Gen 1 authenticity.
- The new learnsets can be consulted in this [file](data/pokemon/evos_moves.asm).
- Stone and trade evolutions keep learning moves.

**Battles**
- Gym leaders' and Elite 4 members' Pokémon have better moves overall.
- Several Gym leader teams were slightly modified (but trying to keep their theme intact!).
- New trainers to fight in new and existing areas. (You may recognize some from the anime!)
- Rematches for Gym leaders and the Elite 4 with stronger teams!
- A new Battle Hall with random 3vs3 battles.

**Wild encounters**
- Wild encounters have been reworked to increase diversity and make many Pokémon available earlier.
- The locations of the Rods was changed – in particular, the Old Rod is now available very early on.
- Fishing encounters were completely reworked in terms of levels and Pokémon diversity.
- For full details (spoilers!), see the files for the [Old rod](data/wild/old_rod.asm), [Good rod](data/wild/good_rod.asm) and [Super rod](data/wild/super_rod.asm).

### Visual updates

- Several tilesets have been reworked, most notably for Viridian Forest and the Pokémon Tower.
- Gym leaders have their own sprites.
- New character sprites when surfing.
- In SuperGameBoy mode, the town palettes have been modified to better reflect the original Japanese town names.
- Many visual bug fixes.

- Use Cut, Surf, Strength, and Flash just by pressing A on the map.
- HMs and other field moves can be taught without taking a move slot.
- Bag space expanded to 30 item slots, and a new dedicated bag pocket for key items.
- Prompt to reuse Repel after finishing one.
- Haunter, Graveler, Kadabra and Machoke can evolve by interacting with new dedicated NPCs.
- Move deleter and Move reminder in Fuchsia.
- Experience bar in battle.
- Improved move info box in battle.
- All TMs can be bought at the Celadon Mart after getting the right badge.
- New Celadon Mart floor where you can buy PP-related items in the postgame (Ether, Elixir, PP Up...).

There are also many other smaller tweaks to the original game, and still more to come!
